        	<h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
        	<p>When it comes to Web Design, I believe that less is more. I create clean, beautiful and intuitive designs, that give your user's an easy and familiar experience.</p>

        <div class="icons">
        	<h3>Front-End</h3>
        	<p>I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, with a touch of front-end libraries and frameworks to build responsive, dynamic websites from scratch. . Writing clean, concise, and semantically correct code is what I love to do.</p>

        	<h3>Back-End</h3>
        	<p>This is where the talking between your computer and the server computer happens, the magic behind the curtain. I build API's, mailing lists, and manage your databases.</p>
